The campaign likely targeted diplomats and began as early as March 2024. Fighting Ursa (aka APT28, Fancy Bear and Sofacy) has been associated with Russian military intelligence and classified as an advanced persistent threat (APT) [PDF].\r\n\r\nDiplomatic-car-for-sale phishing lure themes have been used by Russian threat actors for years. These lures tend to resonate with diplomats and get targets to click on the malicious content.\r\n\r\nUnit 42 has previously observed other threat groups using this tactic. For example, in 2023, a different Russian threat group, Cloaked Ursa, repurposed an advertisement for a BMW for sale to target diplomatic missions within Ukraine. This campaign is not directly connected to the Fighting Ursa campaign described here. However, the similarity in tactics points to known behaviors of Fighting Ursa. The Fighting Ursa group is known for repurposing successful tactics \u2013 even continuously exploiting known vulnerabilities for 20 months after their cover was already blown.\r\n\r\nThe details of the March 2024 campaign, which we attribute to Fighting Ursa with a medium to high level of confidence, indicate the group targeted diplomats and relied on public and free services to host various stages of the attack. This article examines the infection chain from the attack.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed in this article through our Network Security solutions, such as Advanced WildFire and Advanced URL Filtering, as well as our Cortex line of products.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the Unit 42 Incident Response team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\r\nAPTs, Fighting Ursa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial Lure\r\nThe URL kicking off this infection chain was hosted by a legitimate service named Webhook.site, and it was submitted to VirusTotal on March 14, 2024. Webhook.site is a service for legitimate development projects, and it allows its users to create randomized URLs for various purposes like custom automation based on the characteristics of visitors to the URLs.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Fighting Ursa abused Webhook.site to craft a URL that returned a malicious HTML page. Figure 1 below shows the HTML returned from the webhook[.]site URL.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_136057\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"900\"] Figure 1. HTML code used in the attack hosted on the Webhook.site service.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe HTML shown above in Figure 1 has multiple elements that attempt to automate the attack. First, it checks if the visiting computer is Windows-based. If not, it redirects to a decoy image on a URL hosted by another legitimate provider, which is a free service named ImgBB. As the final payload is Windows based, this operating system check is probably an effort to ensure that further actions taken in the attack are only taken for Windows visitors. The HTML then creates a ZIP archive from Base64 text in the HTML, offers it for download and attempts to open it with the JavaScript click() function.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 below shows the decoy image advertising a car for sale, specifically an Audi Q7 Quattro SUV. This fake advertisement is titled \u201cDiplomatic Car For Sale.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe image provides different views of the vehicle. The image also contains contact details that are likely fake, as well as a phone number based in Romania. Finally, the image also lists the point of contact as the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center, possibly to lend this fake advertisement more credibility.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_136063\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1152\"] Figure 2. Diplomatic car for sale lure hosted on ImgBB.[\/caption]\r\nDownloaded Malware\r\nThe downloaded ZIP archive is saved as IMG-387470302099.zip and contains three files listed below in Table 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Size\r\nModified Date and Time\r\nFile Name\r\n\r\n\r\n918,528 bytes\r\n2009-07-13 18:38 UTC\r\nIMG-387470302099.jpg.exe\r\n\r\n\r\n9,728 bytes\r\n2024-03-13 00:37 UTC\r\nWindowsCodecs.dll\r\n\r\n\r\n922 bytes\r\n2024-03-13 00:37 UTC\r\nzqtxmo.bat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1. Contents of the downloaded file IMG-387470302099.zip.\r\n\r\nTable 1 above shows that the first file IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe has a double file extension of .jpg.exe. Windows hosts with a default configuration hide file extensions, so the .jpg.exe file extension only shows as .jpg in the file name. This is a common tactic used by threat actors to trick potential victims into double-clicking the file, in this case believing it will open a car for sale advertisement.\r\n\r\nThe file named IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe is a copy of the legitimate Windows calculator file calc.exe. This file is used to sideload the included DLL file WindowsCodecs.dll, which is a component of the HeadLace backdoor.\r\n\r\nHeadLace is modular malware that executes in stages. This stage-based loading is probably designed to prevent detection and minimize the malware's exposure to analysts. The DLL file contains a function shown below in Figure 3.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_136059\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"661\"] Figure 3. Code in WindowsCodecs.dll file to run a file named zqtxmo.bat.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis function is solely meant to execute the last file within the ZIP archive, zqtxmo.bat. Figure 4 below shows the content of zqtxmo.bat.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_136061\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"900\"] Figure 4. Contents of the zqtxmo.bat batch file.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis batch file starts a process for Microsoft Edge (start msedge) to run content passed as Base64-encoded text. As shown above in Figure 4, the decoded text is a hidden iframe that retrieves content from a different Webhook.site URL.\r\n\r\nThe batch file saves content from this second Webhook.site URL as IMG387470302099.jpg in the user's downloads directory. It then moves the downloaded file into the %programdata% directory and changes the file extension from .jpg to .cmd. Finally, the batch file executes IMG387470302099.cmd, then deletes itself as a way to remove any obvious trace of malicious activity.\r\nAttribution\r\nWe attribute this activity with a medium to high level of confidence to Fighting Ursa based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), characteristics of the attack infrastructure and the malware family attackers used.\r\n\r\nThis attack relies heavily on public and free services to host lures and various stages of the attack. Documentation by IBM, Proofpoint, Recorded Future and others reveal that while the infrastructure used by Fighting Ursa varies for different attack campaigns, the group frequently relies on these freely available services. Furthermore, the tactics from this campaign fit with previously documented Fighting Ursa campaigns, and the HeadLace backdoor is exclusive to this threat actor.\r\nConclusion\r\nFighting Ursa is a motivated threat actor. The infrastructure the group uses has constantly changed and evolved, as noted in a recent report from Recorded Future. Other industry reports have also shown various lures this actor uses in attempts to drop HeadLace malware.\r\n\r\nWe assess that Fighting Ursa will continue to use legitimate web services in its attack infrastructure. To defend against these attacks, defenders should limit access to these or similar hosting services as necessary. If possible, organizations should scrutinize the use of these free services to identify possible attack vectors.\r\nPalo Alto Networks Protection and Mitigation\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products:\r\n\r\n \tCortex XDR detects the attack chain described above, among other protections in the Cortex XDR platform.\r\n \tCortex XSIAM and XSOAR have released a response pack and playbook for automatically detecting the Fighting Ursa threat actor. This playbook downloads the APT28 detection rules and performs extraction, enrichment, and tagging of indicators. It executes our generic Threat Hunting sub-playbook and subsequently provides analysts with recommended workarounds, empowering them to decide the best course of action with the enriched indicators.\r\n \tAdvanced URL Filtering identifies known URLs associated with this activity as malicious.\r\n \tThe Advanced WildFire machine-learning models and analysis techniques have been reviewed and updated in light of the IoCs shared in this research.\r\n\r\nIf you think you may have been compromised or have an urgent matter, get in touch with the Unit 42 Incident Response team or call:\r\n\r\n \tNorth America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842 (866.4.UNIT42)\r\n \tEMEA: +31.20.299.3130\r\n \tAPAC: +65.6983.8730\r\n \tJapan: +81.50.1790.0200\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks has shared these findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

<p>A Russian threat actor we track as <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/fighting-ursa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting Ursa</a> advertised a car for sale as a lure to distribute <a href="https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.headlace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HeadLace</a> backdoor malware. The campaign likely targeted diplomats and began as early as March 2024. Fighting Ursa (aka APT28, Fancy Bear and Sofacy) has been <a href="https://strapi.eurepoc.eu/uploads/Eu_Repo_C_APT_profile_APT_28_4856c0a0ac.pdf">associated with Russian military intelligence and classified as an advanced persistent threat (APT) [PDF]</a>.</p>
<p>Diplomatic-car-for-sale phishing lure themes have been used by Russian threat actors for years. These lures tend to resonate with diplomats and get targets to click on the malicious content.</p>
<p>Unit 42 has previously observed other threat groups using this tactic. For example, in 2023, a different Russian threat group, <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloaked-ursa-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloaked Ursa</a>, repurposed an advertisement for a BMW for sale to target diplomatic missions within Ukraine. This campaign is not directly connected to the Fighting Ursa campaign described here. However, the similarity in tactics points to known behaviors of Fighting Ursa. The Fighting Ursa group is known for repurposing successful tactics – even <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/russian-apt-fighting-ursa-exploits-cve-2023-233397/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuously exploiting known vulnerabilities for 20 months</a> after their cover was already blown.</p>
<p>The details of the March 2024 campaign, which we attribute to Fighting Ursa with a medium to high level of confidence, indicate the group targeted diplomats and relied on public and free services to host various stages of the attack. This article examines the infection chain from the attack.</p>

<h2><a id="post-136054-_wven14kmgum2"></a>Initial Lure</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/7721209735fc8e3d0ccd88bae7f7f37cfcc453288f82b85e57686192a8efd83f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL kicking off this infection chain</a> was hosted by a legitimate service named <a href="https://docs.webhook.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webhook.site</a>, and it was submitted to VirusTotal on March 14, 2024. Webhook.site is a service for legitimate development projects, and it allows its users to create randomized URLs for various purposes like custom automation based on the characteristics of visitors to the URLs.</p>
<p>In this case, Fighting Ursa abused Webhook.site to craft a URL that returned <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cda936ecae566ab871e5c0303d8ff98796b1e3661885afd9d4690fc1e945640e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a malicious HTML page</a>. Figure 1 below shows the HTML returned from the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">webhook[.]site</span> URL.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136057" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-136057" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/word-image-383647-136054-1.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of an HTML document code on a computer screen, displaying various script tags and a hyperlink with a detailed URL.

HTML code used in the attack hosted on the Webhook.site service.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The HTML shown above in Figure 1 has multiple elements that attempt to automate the attack. First, it checks if the visiting computer is Windows-based. If not, it redirects to a decoy image on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/26df5d7ed6748ad3ea9e2e18db3e6535ef99cb4b1a0c46218f91db7626d3efd5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a URL hosted by another legitimate provider</a>, which is a free service named <a href="https://imgbb.com/upload" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImgBB</a>. As the final payload is Windows based, this operating system check is probably an effort to ensure that further actions taken in the attack are only taken for Windows visitors. The HTML then creates a ZIP archive from Base64 text in the HTML, offers it for download and attempts to open it with the JavaScript <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">click()</span> function.</p>
<p>Figure 2 below shows <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7c85ff89b535a39d47756dfce4597c239ee16df88badefe8f76051b836a7cbfb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the decoy image</a> advertising a car for sale, specifically an Audi Q7 Quattro SUV. This fake advertisement is titled “Diplomatic Car For Sale.”</p>
<p>The image provides different views of the vehicle. The image also contains contact details that are likely fake, as well as a phone number based in Romania. Finally, the image also lists the point of contact as the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center, possibly to lend this fake advertisement more credibility.</p>

<p>Table 1. Contents of the downloaded file <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">IMG-387470302099.zip</span>.</p>
<p>Table 1 above shows that the first file <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe</span> has a double file extension of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">.jpg.exe</span>. Windows hosts with a default configuration hide file extensions, so the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">.jpg.exe</span> file extension only shows as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">.jpg</span> in the file name. This is a common tactic used by threat actors to trick potential victims into double-clicking the file, in this case believing it will open a car for sale advertisement.</p>
<p>The file named <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe</span> is a copy of the legitimate Windows calculator file <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">calc.exe</span>. This file is used to sideload the included DLL file <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">WindowsCodecs.dll</span>, which is a component of the <a href="https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.headlace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HeadLace</a> backdoor.</p>
<p>HeadLace is modular malware that executes in stages. This stage-based loading is probably designed to prevent detection and minimize the malware's exposure to analysts. The DLL file contains a function shown below in Figure 3.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136059" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136059" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-136059" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/word-image-393396-136054-3.png" alt="Code snippet displaying a function called DllMain which includes a conditional statement that executes a system command to run &quot;qazmo.bat&quot; when the function's reason for being called equals 1." width="661" height="117" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136059" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.

<p>This function is solely meant to execute the last file within the ZIP archive, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">zqtxmo.bat</span>. Figure 4 below shows the content of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">zqtxmo.bat</span>.</p>

<p>This batch file starts a process for Microsoft Edge (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">start msedge</span>) to run content passed as Base64-encoded text.

<p>The batch file saves content from this second Webhook.site URL as <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">IMG387470302099.jpg</span> in the user's downloads directory. It then moves the downloaded file into the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">%programdata%</span> directory and changes the file extension from <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">.jpg</span> to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">.cmd</span>. Finally, the batch file executes <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">IMG387470302099.cmd</span>, then deletes itself as a way to remove any obvious trace of malicious activity.</p>
<h2><a id="post-136054-_4k02wtf5k3kg"></a>Attribution</h2>
<p>We attribute this activity with a medium to high level of confidence to Fighting Ursa based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), characteristics of the attack infrastructure and the malware family attackers used.</p>
<p>This attack relies heavily on public and free services to host lures and various stages of the attack. Documentation by <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/itg05-ops-leverage-israel-hamas-conflict-lures-to-deliver-headlace-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta422s-dedicated-exploitation-loop-same-week-after-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proofpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/grus-bluedelta-targets-key-networks-in-europe-with-multi-phase-espionage-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recorded Future</a> and others reveal that while the infrastructure used by Fighting Ursa varies for different attack campaigns, the group frequently relies on these freely available services. Furthermore, the tactics from this campaign fit with previously documented Fighting Ursa campaigns, and the <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/itg05-ops-leverage-israel-hamas-conflict-lures-to-deliver-headlace-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HeadLace backdoor is exclusive to this threat actor</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="post-136054-_2an8ryq91inv"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fighting Ursa is a motivated threat actor. The infrastructure the group uses has constantly changed and evolved, as noted in a <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/grus-bluedelta-targets-key-networks-in-europe-with-multi-phase-espionage-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> from Recorded Future. Other industry reports have also shown various lures this actor uses in attempts to drop HeadLace malware.</p>
<p>We assess that Fighting Ursa will continue to use legitimate web services in its attack infrastructure. To defend against these attacks, defenders should limit access to these or similar hosting services as necessary. If possible, organizations should scrutinize the use of these free services to identify possible attack vectors.</p>
